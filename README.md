# PharmaNews-Topic-Categorisation
This repository contain the code, files, data etc. for my final dissertation at Copenhagen University for my master in Communication & IT. The project is made in collaboration with Novo Nordisk A/S, Scientific Intelligence department. The repository is private and falls under a NDA signed by Carl Johanson (researcher), the director of Scientific Intelligence, and my supervisor Anders SÃ¸gaar. All rights reserved.

This project intented to create a domain-specific topic classification model based on a unsupervised dataset of pharmaceutical news. The goal of the project is to correctly predict and classify the topic of future news articles within pharma. To do so, the project uses a combination of topic modelling and machine learning classification. All code is written in Python and is stored in Jypyter Notebooks.

The main interface is considered the only necessary Notebook to use and edit. Use the main interface notebook to extract the data, run and train the models and apply classification to future articles. The main notebook uses commands to run the remaining notebooks.

The working code is located in the "backend-code" directory

To extract the data, you will need access to InfoDesk's API solution. Contact InfoDesk for further clarification. The model is based on data from InfoDesk as it is the main platform used by Scientific Intelligence to extract news.
